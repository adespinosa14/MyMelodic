# 🎵 MyMelodic

MyMelodic is a content-first, instrument-specific knowledge platform designed to make professional music education concepts more accessible — starting with structured articles for instruments like clarinet, organized by family, instrument, and category.

Instead of focusing on practice tracking or accounts first, MyMelodic prioritizes a clean, database-driven knowledge base that mirrors how musicians actually learn:  
**Family → Instrument → Category → Article**

This project is currently an MVP built with Flask and Supabase.
