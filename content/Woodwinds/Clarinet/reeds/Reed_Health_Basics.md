# <div class="center_text"> Reed Health Basics </div>
One of the most important components to a reeded instrument is, well, the reed. The reed determines the sound quality, most times pitch, tone production, articulation styles, and so much more. It's quite surprising how much one's playing improves when you pay extra attention to just the reed and its qualities.

## What is a reed?

Clarinet reeds are typically made out of a type of cane called arundo donax, which grows in abundance in south France. This small piece of cane sits right on top of the mouthpiece, and when moistened and air pushed through it vibrates the cane to produce a sound. There are an abundance of manufacturers of reeds, such as Vandorean, D'addario, Rico, etc. that are made to produce different qualities of sound. It's very important to have many reeds on hand, as no two reeds are the same even if they come in the same box.

## What to do when I get a pack of reeds

### Before Playing
No matter the brand of reeds you get, It's always best practice to break-in each one. Reeds are a natural material, and **climate** matters dramatically. It is very possible that each reed purchased was manufactured, tested, and sealed comes from a different climate from your current location. Before playing a reed, letting an unpacked reed rest between 12-24 hours before working it in is good practice so it can get acclimated to your current climate.

### Once acclimated
When a reed has sat for a day, do ***not*** play on it like a regular practice reed. Since reeds are made of a natural material, when they vibrate the threads inside of the reed could get damaged or wear down very quickly. This dramatically lowers the life span of that reed. Instead, play on the reed for about 5 minutes, then stop to let it rest and dry. When setting the reed to dry, set it upside down, so the most moistened part can set lowering the possibility of **warping**. Once dry, play again for 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, then an hour. It is very common to use this time to practice scales and work on multiple reeds at once. Once this is complete, you may start practicing on it like normal.
